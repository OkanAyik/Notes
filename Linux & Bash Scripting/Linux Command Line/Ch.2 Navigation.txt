The first thing we need to learn is how to navigate the file system on our Linux system.

	pwd : Print name of the current working directory
	cd      : Change directory
	ls       : List directory contents

Understanding the File System Tree     
Linux organizes its files in what is called a hierarchical directory structure. This means they are organized in a tree-like pattern of directories(sometimes called folders in other systems), which may contain files and other directories.
The first directory in the file system is called the root directory. The root directory contains files and subdirectories, which contain more files and sub-directories, and so on.

*Note that unlike Windows, which has separate file system tree for each storage device, Unix-like systems such as Linux always have a single file system tree, regardless of how many drives or storage devices are attached to the computer.

The Current Working Directories
The directory we are standing in is called the current working directory. To display the current working directory, we use the pwd (print working directory) command.
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ pwd 
/home/me
```

*When we first log in to our system(or start a terminal emulator session), our current working directory is set to our home directory.

List the Contents of a Directory
To list the files and directories in the current working directory, we use the ls command.
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ ls 
Desktop Documents Music Pictures Public Templates Videos
```

Actually, we can use the ls command to list the contents of any directory, not just current working directory, and there are many other fun things it can do as well.

Changing the Current Working Directory
To change our working directory, we use the cd command. To do this, type cd followed by the pathname of the desired working directory.
A pathname is the route we take along the branches of the tree to get to the directory we want. 
We can specify pathnames in one of two different ways:  as absolute pathnames  or  as relative pathnames..

Absolute Pathnames
An absolute pathname begin with the root(/) directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed. 
The directory's pathname is /usr/bin. This means from the root directory there is a directory called usr  that contains a directory called bin.
```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ cd /usr/bin 
[me@linuxbox bin]$ pwd 
/usr/bin 
[me@linuxbox bin]$ ls 
...Listing of many, many files ...
```

Relative Pathnames
Where an absolute pathname starts from the root directory and leads to its destination, a relative pathname starts from the working directory.
To do this, it uses a couple of special notations to represent relative positions in the file system tree. 
The special notations are . (dot) and .. (dot dot)
The . notation refers to the working directory, and the .. notation refers to the working directory's parent directory.

```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ cd /usr/bin 
[me@linuxbox bin]$ pwd 
/usr/bin

[me@linuxbox bin]$ cd .. 
[me@linuxbox usr]$ pwd 
/usr
```

```
[me@linuxbox usr]$ cd /usr/bin 
[me@linuxbox bin]$ pwd 
/usr/bin

[me@linuxbox usr]$ cd ./bin 
[me@linuxbox bin]$ pwd 
/usr/bin
```
** Now, there is something important to point out here. In almost all cases, we can omit the ./ part because it is implied. Typing the following does same thing.
```
[me@linuxbox usr]$ cd bin
```



Some Helpful Shortcuts
cd		Changes the working directory to your home directory.
cd -		Changes the working directory to the previous working directory.
cd ~user_name	Changes the working directory to the home directory of user_name. For example, typing cd ~bob will change the directory to the home directory of user “bob.”
